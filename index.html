					<aside class="notes">
						Hello.  First of all, let me thank you all for coming here today. My name is Artur, today I want to talk about history of software development.
						I hope that my presentation would be interesting for You. If you have any questions it would be highly appreciated if you ask them
						on the end of my presentation, thanks :)

					Presentation Plan: <br/><br/>
					<ul>
						<li>Born of software development</li>
						<li>First software companies</li>
						<li>Waterfall approach</li>
						<li>Scrum approach</li>
						<li>Summary & Future</li>
					</ul>
					<br/>
					<aside class="notes">
						Now I want to show plan of my presentation.
						First of all I want to talk about times when software production was on early stage of development.
						Next I want talk more about first approach in which programmers made applications.
						On the end I want talk more about contemporary solutions used to make software

					Old times ( 1939 - 70s ) <br/>
					<img src="./old.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">
						The first computers were very limited. That computers were design to solve only one algorithm problem, reprogramming was hard and
						required rebuild of some part of machine. Next stage was making programmable computers. First programmable computers used punched card to load program, you can see example on image.
						Debugging programs saved on punched card was very hard, because it was't possible to easly change code.
						So it's obvious that makeing programs at that time was very expensive.
						Only US government and army could afford it

					First software companies ( 1975+ ) <br/>
					<img width="600px" src="./windows-old.png">
					<aside class="notes">
						70's become groundbreaking decade. Ordinary people wanted to use power of computers.
						It was time of born Microsoft and Apple companies. Apple created computer which was simple enough to use by not
						technical user. Microsfot at that time worked together with Apple, they provided software for them.
						Global access by people to computers caused increased demand for software.
						Microsoft and other software companies started to hire thousands of programmers to provide new programs for users.

					Waterfall approach <br/>
					<img width="600px" src="./watterfal.png"/>
					<aside class="notes">
						On the beginning model of software development was very fixed. It's called waterfall cause of fixed stages. On image you
						should see all stages of that model. After writing down requirements developers started making program in one scope. After that
						when program was done testers made test and program was released. That model have one big defect, it does't include fact that
						user requirements change in time and software need to modify in time.
					</aside>

				<section>
					Scrum approach <br/>
					<img width="600px" style="background-color: white" src="./scrum.png"/>
					<aside class="notes">
						After some time companies started to use different model. It's called scrum approach. Application is made incrementally.
						Each iteration should provide product which is ready to test. Iteration in that model is called sprint. Typical sprint should
						take not more then 1 week. On the beginning of sprint hole team make meeting where it is determined what is to be done.
						That approach is much more flexible then waterfall, software company can follow different user requirements. Also client of
						companies which use scrum charge client regularly depending from how many programmers in some spint worked on project.
						Everything is more flexible :).

					Summary & <br/> Couple worlds about future <br />
					<img src="./cloud.jpg" width="600px">
					<aside class="notes">
						Thanks to popularization of computers making software become nowadays very popular. On the beginning process was very fixed. Nowadays
						thanks to scrum approach software companies can make programs which grow together with user :).
						Most of modern applications is hosted in internet ( like that presentation ;) ). Thanks that we don't have to even install software on our machines,
						browser it's all what we need. Cloud is a future!
