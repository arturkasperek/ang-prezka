					<aside class="notes">
						Hello.  First of all, let me thank you all for coming here today. My name is Artur, today I want to talk about history of software development.
						I hope that my presentation will be interesting for You. If you have any questions it would be highly appreciated if you ask me at
						the end of my presentation, thanks :)

					Presentation Plan: <br/><br/>
					<ul>
						<li>Born of software development</li>
						<li>First software companies</li>
						<li>Waterfall approach</li>
						<li>Scrum approach</li>
						<li>Summary & Future</li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						Now I want to show you a plan of my presentation.
						First of all I want to talk about times when software production was on early stage of development.
						Next I want to talk more about first approach in which programmers made applications.
						On the end I want to talk more about contemporary solutions used to make software

					Old times ( 1939 - 70s ) <br/>
					<img src="./old.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">
						The first computers were very limited. That computers were design to solve only one algorithm problem, reprogramming was hard and
						required rebuild of some part of machine. Next stage was making programmable computers. First programmable computers used a punched card to load program, you can see example in the image.
						Debugging programs saved on the punched card was very hard, because it was't possible to change code easily.
						So it's obvious that making programs at that time was very expensive.
						Only US government and army could afford to do it

					First software companies ( 1975+ ) <br/>
					<img width="600px" src="./windows-old.png">
					<aside class="notes">
						The 70's become groundbreaking decade. Ordinary people wanted to use the power of computers.
						It was the time of setting-up Microsoft and Apple companies. Apple created computer which was simple enough to use by not
						technical user. Microsfot, at that time, has had working together with Apple, they was providing software for them.
						Global access by people to computers caused increasing demand for software.
						Microsoft and other software companies had started to hire thousands of programmers to provide new programs for users.

					Waterfall approach <br/>
					<img width="600px" src="./watterfal.png"/>
					<aside class="notes">
						At the beginning, the model of software development was very fixed. It's called waterfall cause of fixed stages. In the picture you can see all stages of that model.
						After writing down requirements developers started making program in one scope. Afterwards
						when program had done testers made test and program was released. That model have one big defect, it does't include the fact that
						user requirements change over time and software need to modified.
					</aside>

				<section>
					Scrum approach <br/>
					<img width="600px" style="background-color: white" src="./scrum.png"/>
					<aside class="notes">
						Afterwards companies started to use alternative model. It's called scrum approach. An application is making incrementally.
						Each iteration should provide a product which is ready to test. Iteration in that model is called sprint. Typical sprint should
						take not more then 1 week. On the beginning of sprint a team make meeting where it is determined what is to be done.
						That approach is much more flexible than waterfall. Consequently, companies can meet user's requirements.
						Also clients (of companies) which use scrum, charge client regularly and it depends on an amount of programmers working on a project in that sprint.
						Everything is more flexible :).

					Summary & <br/> Couple worlds about future <br />
					<img src="./cloud.jpg" width="600px">
					<aside class="notes">
						Nowadays making software become very popular becouse of popularization of computers. At the beginning, that process was very fixed. Due to scrum approach
						software companies can make programs that grows together with user :).
						Most of modern applications is hosted in internet ( like that presentation ;) ). Thanks that we don't have to even install software on our machines,
						browser it's all what we need. Cloud is a future!
